         This is a mini mean-variance portfolio selection problem described in
         'GAMS/MINOS: Three examples' by Alan S. Manne, Department of Operations
         Research, Stanford University, May 1986.
       
         Integer variables have been added to restrict the number of securities
         selected. The resulting MINLP problem is solved with different option
         settings to demonstrate some DICOPT features. Finally, the model is
         solved by complete enumeration using GAMS procedural facilities.
