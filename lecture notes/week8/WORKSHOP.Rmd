## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
main <- read.csv('data.csv')
x <- c(main$stage)

p <- matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 4, 0)
for (t in 1:(length(x) - 1)) p[x[t], x[t + 1]] <- p[x[t], x[t + 1]] + 1
for (i in 1:4) p[i, ] <- p[i, ] / sum(p[i, ])
p
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
install.packages("markovchain")
xChar<-as.character(x)
library(markovchain)
mcX<-markovchainFit(xChar)$estimate
mcX
```
